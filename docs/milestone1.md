Question 3: What are you trying to do? (problem or topic) Describe in a couple sentences

We want to use state-level health data to predict chronic disease rates (diabetes, heart disease, COPD, etc.) across US states. The idea is to see which factors like smoking rates, obesity, income, and insurance coverage are the best predictors of how bad chronic disease gets in a given state.

Question 4: Why is this important? Short summary (2-3 sentences) of who cares about this problem, what impact it has, what implications better solutions might have.


Question 5: What dataset(s) are you interested in working with? Add links if possible.

We found the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators dataset on data.gov (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators). It's published by the CDC and has 115 health indicators tracked across all US states, covering things like diabetes, cancer, COPD, tobacco use, and alcohol. The data is at the state level and comes in CSV format.
Chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease cost the US hundreds of billions in healthcare spending every year, and some states deal with way higher rates than others. If we can figure out which factors actually drive those differences, that's useful for deciding where public health funding should go. Right now a lot of that money gets spread around without a great sense of what's working, so even a rough model pointing to the biggest contributors would help.
