DS2500Intermediate Programming with DataSection 3 Lecture 9
Class Project Kickoff
2/6/2026
Benjamin M. Gyori, Ph.D.
Northeastern University

============================================================
SLIDE 2
============================================================
The Class Project: Overview
Your chance to do real data science on a topic you care about
End-to-end project: from raw data to insights and conclusions
Apply everything you've learned this semester - and more
Work collaboratively in teams to tackle a meaningful problem
Tell the story of your data - what did you discover and why does it matter?
This is the capstone experience of DS2500

============================================================
SLIDE 3
============================================================
Teams
Teams of 2-4 students (same lecture section)
We expect a substantive project incorporating contributions from all teammates
Each member should take on a distinct hypothesis-based analysis task
Example: collaborate on data acquisition/cleaning, then each person investigates at least one question
All team members responsible for arranging collaboration and meetings
All team members must be present and participate in the presentation

============================================================
SLIDE 4
============================================================
Project Scope & Expectations
Roughly twice as large/complex as your DS2001 or Fundies project
Must identify a real, substantial dataset - ideally one that interests you
Ethical standards: data collection must be ethical, final report must address bias
All sources and datasets must be cited
Discuss ideas with instructors and TAs in lab or office hours - we encourage it!

============================================================
SLIDE 5
============================================================
Grading & Evaluation
Total: 2,600 points across 5 milestones
Group grade based on all milestones
Individual grade may be adjusted based on peer evaluations
Peer feedback required from every member (failure to submit = 50% deduction)
Non-contributing members: contact Deahan and Ben early, don't wait
Optional extra credit: individual reflection after peer feedback (up to 100 pts)

SLIDE 7
============================================================
Finding a Dataset
Must use real, substantial data
Encouraged: APIs, web scraping, combining multiple sources
The more innovative the data acquisition, the more unique your project
Recommended sources:
TidyTuesday, UCI ML Repository (archive.ics.uci.edu)
CDC, Census, World Bank, data.gov, FiveThirtyEight
Search GitHub for datasets
Ensure ethical data collection standards

============================================================
SLIDE 8
============================================================
Why Not Kaggle?
We highly encourage looking for data from sources other than Kaggle
Kaggle datasets often have questionable provenance
May include synthetic (not real) data
Typically already pre-processed for a specific challenge
By finding your own raw data, your project is more likely to be unique
You can answer questions others haven't already tackled

============================================================
SLIDE 9
============================================================
Past Project: Wildfires in California
Explored causes of wildfires using data from 1921-2023
Analyzed factors: duration, fire intensity, frequency
Derived features: fire intensity, area-to-perimeter ratio
Methods: K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest classifiers
Grouped causes into 3 categories - accuracy improved from 20-30% to over 63%
Finding: wildfire frequency increasing, human-driven causes becoming dominant

============================================================
SLIDE 10
============================================================
Past Project: Eviction Rate Analysis
Investigated factors contributing to eviction rates across the US
Combined data from The Eviction Lab and US Counties Database (2015)
Explored: eviction rates vs race, income, poverty, rent, property values
Key finding: higher eviction rates in areas with greater % of Black renters
Income, poverty rate, rent showed inconsistent relationships
Conclusion: structural inequality may play larger role than financial indicators

============================================================
SLIDE 11
============================================================
Past Project: Diabetes Analysis
Examined links between diabetes and health/demographic factors in Iraqi patients
Dataset: 1,000 patients across 3 classes (diabetic, non-diabetic, pre-diabetic)
Primary method: K-Nearest Neighbors classifier
Results: lower HbA1c levels and younger ages associated with non-diabetic class
Also tested logistic regression - room for improvement in identifying positive cases
Highlighted need for further analysis of factor correlations

============================================================
SLIDE 12
============================================================
Past Project: NFL and Weather
Investigated how weather conditions influence NFL game results
Hypothesis: weather alone would not have major impact on outcomes
Methods: KNN classifier, multiple linear regression, feature scaling
Results: temperature alone was a poor predictor (accuracy 0.58, F1 0.25)
Marginal negative correlation: closer games in warmer weather
Takeaway: weather alone not a strong predictor - many other factors at play

============================================================
SLIDE 13
============================================================
More Topic Ideas
Stock market trend prediction
House price prediction
Medical diagnosis prediction
Movie recommendation system
Game/sport outcome prediction
Public transit usage trend analysis
Your project should be unique - these are just starting points
Best projects combine a unique dataset with interesting questions
